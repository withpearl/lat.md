# CLI

The `lat` command line tool. Entry point: [[src/cli/index.ts]].

**Design principle: shared core, thin wrappers.** Every CLI command and its corresponding [[cli#mcp]] tool share the same command function (e.g. `locateCommand`, `sectionCommand`, `refsCommand`). Each command function accepts a `CmdContext` (with a `Styler` abstraction for chalk vs plain formatting) and returns a `CmdResult` (`{ output, isError? }`). CLI and MCP are thin wrappers that construct the appropriate context and handle the result — CLI calls `handleResult` (print + exit code), MCP calls `toMcp` (wrap in MCP response). Some commands have a separate business-logic layer (e.g. `getSection`, `findRefs`, `runSearch`) that returns structured data, called by the command function. Shared types live in [[src/context.ts]]. Never duplicate business logic between CLI and MCP.

## locate

Find sections by query. Strips `[[brackets]]` and leading `#` from the query before searching. Results are returned in priority order:

1. **Exact match** — full section path matches (case-insensitive). If the query contains `#` (a full path) and matches exactly, returns immediately.
2. **File stem match** — for bare names (no `#`), the query is matched against file stems via `buildFileIndex`. e.g. `locate` matches the root section of `tests/locate.md`. For queries with `#`, the file part is expanded: `setup#Install` → `guides/setup#Install`. Results sorted by depth (shallower first) then path depth.
3. **Subsection match** — the query matches a trailing segment of a section id. e.g. `Frontmatter` matches `markdown#Frontmatter`. Skipped when the query contains `#`.
4. **Subsequence match** — query `#`-segments are a subsequence of the section id segments. e.g. `Markdown#Resolution Rules` matches `markdown#Wiki Links#Resolution Rules` (1 intermediate section skipped). Requires at least 2 query segments.
5. **Fuzzy match** — sections whose id or trailing segments are within edit distance (Levenshtein, max 40% of string length). e.g. `Frontmattar` matches `markdown#Frontmatter`. For queries with `#`, when the file part matches exactly, only the heading portion is compared — prevents the shared file prefix from inflating similarity (e.g. `cli#locat` matches `cli#locate` but not `cli#prompt`).

Outputs a [[cli#Section Preview]] for each match.

Usage: `lat locate <query>`

Implementation: [[src/cli/locate.ts]], matching logic in [[src/lattice.ts#findSections]]

## section

Show a section's full content including all subsections, along with outgoing and incoming wiki link references. Companion to [[cli#search]] — search gives RAG results, `section` lets you browse them by showing the full context of each result.

Accepts any valid section id (short-form, full-path, with or without `[[brackets]]`). Uses the same resolution logic as [[cli#refs]].

Output:

1. Section header with id and file location
2. Section content blockquoted (`>`) from `startLine` through the end of the last descendant subsection
3. **This section references** — all wiki link targets found within the section, including both lat.md section refs (with body descriptions) and source code refs (with file path and line range, e.g. `file.ts:10-25`, plus a 5-line snippet centered on the symbol)
4. **Referenced by** — other sections in `lat.md/` that contain wiki links pointing to this section
5. **Referenced by code** — source files containing `@lat:` comments that reference this section, each shown with file path, line number, and a 5-line snippet centered on the reference
6. **Navigation hints** — same footer as [[cli#search]], suggesting `lat section` and `lat search` as next steps

Usage: `lat section <query>`

Core logic in [[src/cli/section.ts#getSection]] (returns structured result), used by both the CLI command and [[cli#mcp]] `lat_section` tool. Incoming links and `@lat:` back-references come from a [[src/cli/section.ts#buildSectionIndex]] built per call — or built once and shared when a caller looks up several sections.

## refs

Find sections that reference a given target via [[parser#Wiki Links]]. The query can be a section id or a source file path.

**Section queries** (e.g. `section-parsing#Heading`) are resolved via `findSections` when `resolveRef` doesn't produce an exact match, as long as the result is unambiguous (exact, stem-expanded, or section-name match). If no confident match exists, shows "Did you mean:" suggestions and exits.

**Source file queries** (e.g. `src/app.rs#greet`, `src/app.ts`) are detected when the file part has a recognized source extension and exists on disk. File-level queries (no `#`) match all wiki links targeting that file or any symbol in it. Symbol-level queries match exactly.

Outputs a [[cli#Section Preview]] for each referring section.

Usage: `lat refs <query> [--scope=md|code|md+code]`

### Scope

- `md` — search `lat.md` markdown files for wiki links targeting the query
- `code` — scan source files for `@lat: [[...]]` comments matching the query
- `md+code` (default) — both

Core logic in [[src/cli/refs.ts#findRefs]] (returns structured result), used by both the CLI command and [[cli#mcp]] `lat_refs` tool.

## check

Validation command group. Without a subcommand it runs every check against the
discovered `lat.md/`; an explicit `-- <directory>` suffix validates any
Markdown directory instead.

A whole-vault run — `lat check` with no subcommand, and the Stop hook — reads and
parses the vault once ([[src/cli/check.ts#loadVault]]) and shares it across the md,
links, code-refs and sections phases; a phase run alone loads its own.

Usage: `lat check [md|links|code-refs|index|sections] [-- <directory>]`

The separator is required. It keeps directory names distinct from subcommands:
`lat check links` runs the relative-link subcommand against the discovered
`lat.md/`, while `lat check -- links` runs every validator against a directory
named `links`. Exactly one directory must follow `--`.

Every subcommand supports the same suffix, such as
`lat check code-refs -- docs`. For explicit directories, section ids remain
relative to the containing project root and code references are scanned from
that root. The full check skips the `lat init` version warning because the
directory is not required to have lat setup metadata.

Emits a stale-init warning before any errors so the user sees setup issues first. The init version check compares `INIT_VERSION` in [[src/init-version.ts]] against the version in `lat.md/.cache/lat_init.json` written by [[cli#init]]. If the total check took longer than one second and ripgrep is not installed, shows a tip suggesting the user install it for faster scanning. The first output line ("Scanned ...") includes the total elapsed time (e.g. "in 250ms" or "in 1.2s").

Implementation: [[src/cli/check.ts]]

### md

Validate that all [[parser#Wiki Links]] in the checked markdown files point to existing sections.

### links

Validate that ordinary markdown links in the checked files point to existing files, Markdown fragments use GitHub heading ids, and full or collapsed reference-style links have definitions. See [[markdown#Relative Links]] for exact rules.

### code-refs

Two validations:

1. Every `// @lat: [[...]]` or `# @lat: [[...]]` comment in source code must point to a real section in `lat.md/`
2. For files with [[markdown#Frontmatter#require-code-mention]], every leaf section must be referenced by at least one `// @lat:` comment in the codebase

### sections

Validate that every section has a well-formed leading paragraph. Two checks:

1. **Missing leading paragraph** — every section must have at least one paragraph before its first child heading. Sections with only headings and no prose are errors.
2. **Overly long leading paragraph** — the first paragraph must be ≤250 characters (excluding `[[wiki link]]` content). This guarantees the section's essence fits in search chunks and command output without truncation.

The character count strips all `[[...]]` wiki link syntax before measuring, so long link targets don't penalize the count.

### index

Validate directory index files. Every directory inside `lat.md/` (including the root) must have an index file named after the directory with a bullet list of its contents.

Each index file must contain a bullet list covering every visible file and subdirectory with a one-sentence description, using wiki links: `- [[name]] — description`. File entries omit the `.md` extension (e.g. `[[cli]]` not `[[cli.md]]`). Root example: `lat.md/lat.md`; subdirectory example: `lat.md/api/api.md`.

Four checks:

1. **Non-markdown files** — any file without a `.md` extension is flagged as an error (only markdown belongs in the checked directory)
2. **Missing index file** — errors with a ready-to-copy bullet list snippet
3. **Missing entries** — index file exists but doesn't list all visible entries
4. **Stale entries** — index file lists an entry that doesn't exist on disk

Only `.md` files participate in index validation — non-markdown files are reported separately and excluded from the directory listing.

Directory walking uses [[dev-process#File Walking]] to respect `.gitignore` rules — hidden/ignored entries (`.cache`, `.obsidian`, etc.) are automatically excluded.

## expand

Expand `[[refs]]` in text to resolved `lat.md` section paths with location context. Designed for coding agents to pipe user prompts through before processing. Renamed from `prompt` (which remains as a hidden deprecated alias).

Usage: `lat expand <text>` or `echo "text" | lat expand`

For each `[[ref]]` in the input, uses `findSections()` directly (no `resolveRef`):

1. **Best match** — resolves to the top result from `findSections` (exact > file stem > subsection > subsequence > fuzzy)
2. **No match** — errors out, tells the agent to ask the user to correct the reference

Output replaces `[[ref]]` with `[[resolved-id]]` inline and appends a `<lat-context>` block as a nested outliner. For exact matches: `is referring to:`. For non-exact: `might be referring to either of the following:` with all candidates, match reasons, locations, and body text.

Implementation: [[src/cli/expand.ts]]

## gen

Generate a file to stdout from a built-in template.

Usage: `lat gen <target>`

Supported targets:

- `agents.md` — generate an `AGENTS.md` with instructions for coding agents on how to use `lat.md` in the project
- `claude.md` — alias for `agents.md`
- `cursor-rules.md` — generate Cursor rules for `.cursor/rules/lat.md`
- `pi-extension.ts` — generate the Pi extension template (tools + lifecycle hooks)
- `skill.md` — generate the Agent Skills spec `SKILL.md` for the `lat-md` skill (authoring guide for `lat.md/` files)

Output is written to stdout so it can be redirected: `lat gen agents.md > AGENTS.md`.

Implementation: [[src/cli/gen.ts]]

## init

Interactive setup wizard. Walks the user through initializing lat.md in a project, with per-agent configuration for multiple coding tools.

Usage: `lat init [dir]`

Steps:

1. **lat.md/ directory** — if not present, asks whether to create it (via a one-off readline interface that is closed before step 2). Scaffolds from `templates/init/` (`.gitignore` and `README.md`). If it already exists, skips ahead.
2. **Embedding setup** — fresh and outdated setups default to a per-repository local preference before agent selection, unless the repo already has a _working_ hosted setup (a hosted `meta.embedding_model` plus a resolvable key for the same provider and model). That exception matters because the outdated check re-fires on every `INIT_VERSION` bump, so pinning local unconditionally would keep undoing a deliberate hosted choice; a hosted index with no compatible key is unusable, so it does fall back to local. In a TTY, if a key resolves from `LAT_LLM_KEY`, `LAT_LLM_KEY_FILE`, `LAT_LLM_KEY_HELPER`, or user config, init asks whether to stay local or use hosted embeddings; fresh repos default local, while re-runs default to their existing backend. When that choice differs from `meta.embedding_model`, including a change between hosted providers, interactive init offers to reindex immediately. Non-interactive init never chooses: it applies the local default only where no working hosted setup exists, and prints the required command for any mismatch.
3. **Agent selection** — interactive checklist menu ([[src/cli/checklist-menu.ts#checklistMenu]]). All agents are shown at once with `[x]`/`[ ]` checkboxes; the cursor row is highlighted with `chalk.bgCyan`. Keys: up/down (j/k) to move, Space to toggle, Enter to confirm, Ctrl+C to abort. Returns an array of selected agent values. Non-TTY fallback returns `[]`. After confirmation, prints a summary line (e.g. "Selected: Claude Code, Cursor" or dim "None"). **Important:** the persistent readline interface is created _after_ this step — `checklistMenu` puts stdin into raw mode with its own `data` listener, which corrupts any co-existing readline interface.
4. **Command style** — if any agent is selected, a `selectMenu` asks "How should agents run lat?" with three options: `lat` (global install, portable), the resolved local invocation, or `npx lat.md@latest` (slow but zero-install). Local JavaScript builds retain the exact Node executable that launched init, and TypeScript entry points also retain their loader flags; wrapper scripts and standalone binaries remain direct commands. The choice determines what command string is written into hooks, MCP configs, and Pi extensions. Non-interactive mode defaults to `local`. Choosing `global` or `npx` makes generated config files portable and safe to commit.
5. **AGENTS.md** — created if a non-Claude agent is selected (Cursor, Copilot, Codex). Shared instruction file. Uses marker-based append mode (see below).
6. **Per-agent setup** — configures each selected agent (see subsections below). Each step prints a brief explanation of _why_ it's needed (e.g. why a hook is used instead of CLAUDE.md, why MCP is registered alongside CLI access).
7. **Version stamp + file hashes** — writes `INIT_VERSION` and SHA-256 hashes of all template-generated files to `lat.md/.cache/lat_init.json`. The version is also stamped when no agents are selected, because embedding setup has completed and must not be treated as fresh on the next run. On re-run, compares current file content against stored hashes: unmodified files are silently updated to the latest template; user-modified files trigger a Y/n prompt offering to overwrite with the latest template, declining suggests [[cli#gen]].
8. **Next steps** — after all setup completes, prints agent-specific guidance for having the agent document the codebase. For Claude Code, shows a runnable `claude "..."` command. For IDE agents (Cursor, Copilot, Pi, OpenCode, Codex), shows the prompt to paste into agent chat. Both suggest running `lat check` when done.

At the very end, after all steps complete, init checks whether ripgrep (`rg`) is available. If missing, prints a tip suggesting the user install it for faster code scanning, with a link to the ripgrep installation guide.

At the very start, before any steps, init prints the ASCII `lat.md` logo (cyan, matching the website) followed by "Checking latest version..." and awaits [[src/version.ts#fetchLatestVersion]] (3s timeout). If a newer version exists, prints an update notice so the user can upgrade before proceeding. If the fetch fails or the version matches, the message is cleared silently.

### Claude Code

Sets up `CLAUDE.md` and two agent hooks for the Claude Code coding agent.

- `CLAUDE.md` — written using marker-based append mode (see below), preserving any user content outside the `%% lat:begin %%` / `%% lat:end %%` markers
- Hooks synced in `.claude/settings.json` — on every run, all existing lat-owned hook entries are removed, then fresh entries are added for both events. Detection uses three heuristics: `/\blat\b/` in the command string, `hook claude ` substring (catches any install path), or command starting with the current binary path. Non-lat hooks are preserved. Both hooks call [[cli#hook]]:
  - `UserPromptSubmit` → `lat hook claude UserPromptSubmit` — injects lat.md workflow reminders, auto-resolves `[[refs]]` in the prompt
  - `Stop` → `lat hook claude Stop` — reminds the agent to update `lat.md/` before finishing
- `.claude/skills/lat-md/SKILL.md` — skill spec generated from `templates/skill/SKILL.md`. Teaches the agent how to author and maintain `lat.md/` files. Claude Code discovers it automatically from `.claude/skills/`.
- `.claude` directory added to `.gitignore` (settings contain local absolute paths in hook commands)
- [[cli#mcp]] server registered in `.mcp.json` at the project root (added to `.gitignore` since it contains absolute paths)

### Pi

Sets up a Pi extension that registers lat tools as native Pi tools and hooks into the agent lifecycle.

- `AGENTS.md` — shared instruction file (created in the shared step)
- `.pi/extensions/lat.ts` — TypeScript extension generated from `templates/pi-extension.ts` with the full invocation command injected. `resolveLatBin()` in `init.ts` runs local `.js` builds through their Node executable, captures `node <execArgv> <script>` for `.ts` source files run via tsx, and invokes executable wrappers or standalone binaries directly. Registers six tools (`lat_search`, `lat_section`, `lat_locate`, `lat_check`, `lat_expand`, `lat_refs`) that shell out to the `lat` CLI. Each tool provides a `renderCall` method so the Pi TUI displays the query/parameters inline in the tool call header (e.g. `lat search "query text"`). The `lat_search` and `lat_section` tools also provide a `renderResult` method that shows a collapsed preview (first 4 lines) by default and renders the full output as styled markdown (via pi's `Markdown` component and `getMarkdownTheme()`) when expanded via Ctrl+O (`expandTools` keybinding). Registers custom message renderers for `lat-reminder` and `lat-check` that show a collapsed one-liner by default and expand to full markdown-rendered content on Ctrl+O. Hooks into `before_agent_start` (injects a visible search reminder via `customType` message with `display: true`) and `agent_end` (runs `lat check` + diff analysis, sends a visible follow-up message if something needs fixing).
- `.pi/skills/lat-md/SKILL.md` — skill spec generated from `templates/skill/SKILL.md`. Teaches the agent how to author and maintain `lat.md/` files (section structure, wiki links, code refs, test specs). Pi discovers it automatically from the `.pi/skills/` directory.
- `.pi` directory added to `.gitignore` (extension and skills contain local paths)

### Cursor

Sets up `.cursor/rules`, a Cursor stop hook, and the MCP server for Cursor.

- `.cursor/rules/lat.md` — rules file generated from `templates/cursor-rules.md`, references MCP tools instead of CLI commands
- `.cursor/hooks.json` — generated stop hook config (`version: 1`) that runs `lat hook cursor stop`. It enforces the end-of-task `lat check` and `lat.md/` sync reminder in Cursor's native hook format.
- [[cli#mcp]] server registered in `.cursor/mcp.json`
- `.agents/skills/lat-md/SKILL.md` — skill spec for authoring `lat.md/` files, placed in the cross-agent standard skills directory

The `.cursor` directory is added to `.gitignore` because its hooks and MCP config may contain local paths. Cursor still relies on rules plus MCP for prompt-time search guidance because its hooks do not reliably inject prompt-specific context the way Claude/Pi integrations do.

### VS Code Copilot

Sets up `copilot-instructions.md` and registers the MCP server for VS Code Copilot.

- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — instructions file written using marker-based append mode, preserving any user content outside the markers
- [[cli#mcp]] server registered in `.vscode/mcp.json`
- `.agents/skills/lat-md/SKILL.md` — skill spec for authoring `lat.md/` files, placed in the cross-agent standard skills directory

### OpenCode

Sets up an OpenCode plugin that registers lat tools as native OpenCode tools and hooks into the session lifecycle.

- `AGENTS.md` — shared instruction file (created in the shared step)
- `.opencode/plugins/lat.ts` — TypeScript plugin generated from `templates/opencode-plugin.ts` with the lat invocation command injected. Uses `@opencode-ai/plugin` to register six tools (`lat_search`, `lat_section`, `lat_locate`, `lat_check`, `lat_expand`, `lat_refs`) that shell out to the `lat` CLI. Hooks into `session.idle` (runs `lat check` + diff analysis, logs a warning via `client.app.log` if something needs fixing).
- `.agents/skills/lat-md/SKILL.md` — skill spec for authoring `lat.md/` files, placed in the cross-agent standard skills directory
- `.opencode` directory added to `.gitignore` (plugin contains local absolute paths)

### Codex

Sets up AGENTS.md, lifecycle hooks, the MCP server, and skills for the Codex CLI agent.

- `AGENTS.md` — shared instruction file (created in the shared step)
- `.codex/hooks.json` — merges lat-owned `UserPromptSubmit` and `Stop` command hooks while preserving unrelated hooks. The prompt hook injects reminders, expands `[[refs]]`, and supplies indexed lat.md context; the stop hook runs validation and continues the turn when documentation needs work. Codex requires users to review and trust project hooks through `/hooks` before they run.
- [[cli#mcp]] server registered in `.codex/config.toml` as a `[mcp_servers.lat]` TOML table
- `.codex` directory added to `.gitignore` (hooks and config can contain local absolute paths)
- `.agents/skills/lat-md/SKILL.md` — skill spec for authoring `lat.md/` files, placed in the cross-agent standard skills directory
- `.codex/skills/lat-md/SKILL.md` — same skill spec in Codex's native skills directory

All setup steps are idempotent — existing configuration is detected and skipped.

`.gitignore` entries are only added if the target path is not already tracked in git (`git ls-files`); if tracked, the step prints a warning and skips to avoid a no-op ignore rule.

### Generated instruction ownership

Generated agent instructions and `lat-md` skills direct project-specific documentation into `lat.md/` so it survives setup refreshes.

The `AGENTS.md` and `lat-md` `SKILL.md` templates state that these generated files are owned by lat tooling and may be replaced by a later `lat init`. Agents must record project guidance in `lat.md/` rather than changing generated copies.

### Marker-based append mode

Shared files use `appendTemplateSection` to preserve user content outside lat's managed section.

Template content is wrapped in visible `%% lat:begin %%` / `%% lat:end %%` markers. Applies to CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, and `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. On re-run: if markers exist and the section matches, it's skipped ("already up to date"); if the section matches the stored hash (unmodified by user), it's replaced in-place; if the user edited the section, init asks before replacing. If the file exists but has no markers (old full-overwrite init), and the full-file hash matches the stored hash, the existing content is migrated to marker format in-place. If the file has user content and no markers, the section is appended to the end. All other agent files (rules, skills, hooks, extensions, plugins) still use full-file `writeTemplateFile` since lat owns those entirely.

Implementation: [[src/cli/init.ts]], checklist menu in [[src/cli/checklist-menu.ts]], single-select menu in [[src/cli/select-menu.ts]], version tracking in [[src/init-version.ts]]

## Configuration File

User-level configuration is stored in `~/.config/lat/config.json` (XDG Base Directory on Linux/macOS, `%APPDATA%\lat\config.json` on Windows). The `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` env var is respected if set.

Currently supports:

- `repos` — per-repository embedding preferences keyed by absolute `lat.md/` path; `lat init` records `embedding: "local"` unless the user explicitly selects hosted embeddings
- `llm_key` — optional hosted embedding API key, set manually by power users and used when `LAT_LLM_KEY` is not set

Key resolution order: `LAT_LLM_KEY` > `LAT_LLM_KEY_FILE` > `LAT_LLM_KEY_HELPER` > config file `llm_key`. This applies to `lat search`, `lat reindex`, `lat init`, and the MCP `lat_search` tool.

Implementation: [[src/config.ts]]

## hook

Handle agent hook events. Called by agent hooks configured during `lat init`, not directly by users.

Usage: `lat hook <agent> <event>`

Currently supports:

- `claude` with `UserPromptSubmit` and `Stop`
- `codex` with `UserPromptSubmit` and `Stop`
- `cursor` with `stop`

### UserPromptSubmit

Reads the hook input from stdin (Claude JSON with `user_prompt` or Codex JSON with `prompt`). Outputs the shared Claude/Codex JSON shape with `additionalContext` containing:

1. A directive to ALWAYS run `lat search` on the user's intent before starting work — even for seemingly straightforward tasks — because search may reveal critical design details, protocols, or constraints. Includes a hard gate: do not read files, write code, or run commands until search is done.
2. A reminder that `lat.md/` must stay in sync with meaningful codebase state: update relevant current-state sections for behavior, architecture, tests, or planned-work changes, but do not use `lat.md/` as a journal/changelog or grow it for insignificant details.
3. If the prompt contains `[[refs]]`, resolves them inline using [[src/cli/expand.ts#expandPrompt]]
4. Runs [[src/cli/search.ts#runSearch]] on the user prompt in **read-only mode** (`buildIndex: false`) — it searches an existing index but never builds or updates one, so a user's first prompt in a fresh repo isn't blocked by a full local embed pass (building the index is `lat search` / [[cli#reindex]], and until then this returns no matches). Then, with the vault parsed once and shared with the search, one [[src/cli/section.ts#buildSectionIndex]] for all results and [[src/cli/section.ts#getSection]] + [[src/cli/section.ts#formatSectionOutput]] on each — the agent gets full section content with outgoing/incoming refs before it starts work. Gracefully degrades when nothing is indexed yet or the backend can't serve the index.

### Stop

Conditionally continues Claude or Codex — only when something is actually wrong. Both agents use the same `decision: "block"` response and `stop_hook_active` loop guard.

1. **No `lat.md/` dir** — exit silently.
2. **Run `lat check`** — always, on both first and second pass.
3. **Second pass** (`stop_hook_active` true) — if check still fails, print warning to stderr (no block, loop stops). If check passes, exit silently.
4. **First pass** — run `git diff HEAD --numstat`. Count `codeLines` (files matching [[src/source-parser.ts#SOURCE_EXTENSIONS]]) and `latMdLines`. Skip ratio check if `codeLines < 5` or `latMdLines >= 50` (enough doc work was clearly done). Otherwise round `latMdLines` up to 1 (if nonzero) and flag `needsSync` when `latMdLines < codeLines * 5%`.
5. **Decision** — both pass: exit silently, clean output. Check failed + needs sync: block ("update relevant current-state `lat.md/` sections if needed, then run `lat check` until it passes"). Check failed only: block ("run `lat check` until it passes"). Needs sync only: block with explicit context ("not updated" when 0 lat.md lines, "may not be fully in sync (N lines)" when some changes exist but below ratio) and a reminder not to add journal/changelog noise.

### cursor stop

Runs the same `lat check` and diff analysis as Claude's `Stop` hook, but emits Cursor's `followup_message` payload instead of Claude's block response so the agent continues its loop in Cursor.

Implementation: [[src/cli/hook.ts]]

## mcp

Start the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server over stdio. Exposes lat.md tools to any MCP-capable coding agent (Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code Copilot).

Usage: `lat mcp`

Clients invoke this as `lat mcp`. The `lat init` wizard registers the MCP server using the absolute path to the current `lat` binary, so it works regardless of how `lat` was installed. The server exposes six tools:

- **lat_locate** — find sections by name (wraps [[cli#locate]])
- **lat_section** — show section content with outgoing/incoming refs (wraps [[cli#section]])
- **lat_search** — semantic search across sections (wraps [[cli#search]])
- **lat_expand** — expand `[[refs]]` in text (wraps [[cli#expand]])
- **lat_check** — validate links and code refs (wraps [[cli#check]])
- **lat_refs** — find references to a section (wraps [[cli#refs]])

Each MCP tool calls the same command function as the CLI (e.g. `locateCommand`, `refsCommand`, `searchCommand`), passing a `CmdContext` with `plainStyler` and `mode: 'mcp'`. The `toMcp()` helper converts `CmdResult` to MCP response format. Uses `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` with stdio transport. Resolves `lat.md/` from cwd.

Implementation: [[src/mcp/server.ts]]

## search

Semantic search across `lat.md` sections using vector embeddings. Works **offline by default** — no
API key required.

Usage: `lat search [query] [--limit=5]`

Query is optional — `lat search` with no query just builds the index on first use. `lat search` only reads; rebuilding is [[cli#reindex]]. Results include a navigation hint footer suggesting `lat locate`, `lat refs`, and `lat search` for further exploration — this makes the tools self-documenting so agents discover them organically.

Core search logic in [[src/cli/search.ts#runSearch]] (returns matched sections), used by both the CLI command and [[cli#mcp]] `lat_search` tool. The vault is parsed once per search and shared by the index pass and hit resolution; a caller that already holds a parse (the prompt hook) passes it as `opts.sections`. Indexing/storage internals are in `src/search/`; all embedding generation lives in the `@lat.md/embed` package (see [[cli#search#Embeddings]]).

### Backend selection

lat.md contains no embedding-generation logic — [[src/search/embedder.ts#embedderForIndex]] resolves
an `Embedder` and hands it to the pipeline. The backend is **governed by the index**, not re-decided
from the environment on each search: `meta.embedding_model` (see [[cli#search#Storage]]) is
authoritative.

- **Fresh index** (no `meta` yet — first run, the regenerable `.cache` was wiped, or a legacy
  `.cache` from a version that never recorded the model) — a durable per-repo preference wins first:
  [[cli#init]] defaults new repositories to local and asks before using an available hosted key;
  [[cli#reindex]] maintains explicit backend changes in the config's `repos` map, keyed by lat.md
  dir. A local preference rebuilds locally and ignores any key. Repositories without a preference
  decide from the environment (key → hosted, else local). The resulting model is recorded in `meta`
  only after the index build succeeds, so a failed build never pins a broken backend. A legacy
  `.cache` that has rows but no recorded
  model is dropped and rebuilt from scratch (its vectors may be a different dimension), never queried.
- **`local:`-prefixed model** — use the local backend; `LAT_LLM_KEY` is ignored entirely.
- **Remote model** — the key is required and is used to embed the query on **every** search. If it
  is absent, rejected (401/403 → `EmbeddingAuthError`), or resolves to a different model, `lat search`
  throws [[src/search/embedder.ts#ReindexRequiredError]] and stops — it never silently switches or
  rebuilds. The user runs [[cli#reindex]] to re-decide the backend.

Key resolution is unchanged ([[src/config.ts#getLlmKey]], priority: `LAT_LLM_KEY` →
`LAT_LLM_KEY_FILE` → `LAT_LLM_KEY_HELPER` → `llm_key` config). The key prefix picks the hosted
provider (detected in `@lat.md/embed`):

- (no key) — **local** `@lat.md/embed-minilm-fp16` (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, 384 dims, name `local:minilm-l6-v2`)
- `sk-...` — OpenAI (`text-embedding-3-small`, 1536 dims)
- `vck_...` — Vercel AI Gateway (`openai/text-embedding-3-small`, 1536 dims)
- `sk-ant-...` — Anthropic (not supported, errors with guidance)
- `REPLAY_LAT_LLM_KEY::<url>` — test-only replay server for the hosted path

Implementation: [[src/search/embedder.ts]], [[src/config.ts]]

### Embeddings

All embedding generation is isolated in the `@lat.md/embed` package, exposed through one
[[packages/embed/src/index.ts#createEmbedder]] entry point returning an `Embedder`
(`{ name, dimensions, embed() }`). Two backends:

- **local** — a candle (Rust) BERT engine compiled to WebAssembly ([[packages/embed/src/local.ts#createLocalEmbedder]]), driven by a `ModelManifest` from a weights package (`@lat.md/embed-minilm-fp16`, fp16 weights up-cast to fp32 at load). Pure WASM, no native binaries; masked-mean pooling + L2 normalize, matching `sentence-transformers`. Texts are embedded one at a time (the engine is single-threaded with no batch speedup, and padding a batch to its longest item wastes work); large jobs fan out across `worker_threads` (one engine per CPU, [[packages/embed/src/worker.ts]]) while small jobs run inline.
- **remote** — direct `fetch()` to an OpenAI-compatible `/v1/embeddings` endpoint, batching up to 2048 texts per request ([[packages/embed/src/remote.ts#detectProvider]]).

### Storage

Uses `@libsql/client` in local file mode. Under Node, file URLs load the native `libsql` platform binding, so database handles follow native OS lifetime and locking rules.

Vector search is built into libsql via `F32_BLOB` column type, `libsql_vector_idx` for indexing, and `vector_top_k()` for KNN queries. Returned candidates retain their exact cosine similarity as a score for downstream consumers.

The DiskANN index is created with `compress_neighbors=float1bit` and `search_l=1600` ([[src/search/db.ts#ensureSectionsSchema]]). Each graph node stores a copy of every neighbour's vector; at float32 those copies were ~94% of the file (a 7 MB corpus built a 1.3 GB index), at one bit per dimension each node block is ~15x smaller. Compression only steers traversal — every visited candidate is ranked by its full-precision vector — and libSQL's default degree rises (51 → 60 neighbours at 384 dims) because edges got cheaper.

One-bit distances steer less precisely, so the search beam is widened from libSQL's default 200 candidates. Measured on a 16k-section corpus against exact search over 568 real queries: float1bit alone dropped recall@5 from 99.93% to 98.38% and returned different results run to run; at `search_l=1600` recall@5 is 100% and results are stable, for ~0.15 s per query. A wider graph (`insert_l`) did not help.

Both settings are fixed at `CREATE INDEX`. An existing index is never converted in place (`CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`); it keeps its layout until [[cli#reindex]] recreates it.

Single `sections` table holds metadata, content, content hash, and the embedding vector. No separate vector table needed. The `meta` table records the embedding model + dimensions the index was built with ([[src/search/db.ts#getStoredModel]], e.g. `local:minilm-l6-v2:384` or `openai:1536`). This record is authoritative for [[cli#search#Backend selection]] — vectors from different models are not comparable, so a model change never silently rebuilds; [[cli#reindex]] drops (via [[src/search/db.ts#dropSections]]) and rebuilds explicitly.

The database is stored at `lat.md/.cache/vectors.db` and should not be committed (included in `.gitignore` template).

Implementation: [[src/search/db.ts]]

### Indexing

Sections come from `loadAllSections()` + `flattenSections()`. Each file is read once ([[src/search/index.ts#loadFileLines]]) and each section's raw markdown (`startLine`–`endLine`, not just `firstParagraph`) is sliced from it for richer semantic signal.

Never read per section: that is O(sections × file size), and a 3.5 MB file holding 12k sections cost ~95 s per search before the query even ran.

Content freshness is tracked via SHA-256 hashes. On each run:

1. Parse all sections, compute hashes
2. Compare against stored hashes in the DB
3. Only re-embed new or changed sections (saves API cost / local compute)
4. Delete DB rows for sections that no longer exist

On first run, automatically indexes all sections. A full rebuild is [[cli#reindex]].

Implementation: [[src/search/index.ts]]

### Vector Search

Embeds the user's query via the active embedder, then runs a `vector_top_k()` KNN query joined back to the sections table.

Implementation: [[src/search/search.ts]]

## reindex

Rebuilds the embedding index — the single write/rebuild path (`lat search` only reads). Usage:
`lat reindex [--local] [--remote] [--yes]`.

Backend selection honors the **durable per-repo preference**: a repo pinned to local rebuilds local
and ignores `LAT_LLM_KEY` (printing a note when a key is nonetheless set). Flags override: `--local`
forces the offline model; `--remote` re-resolves from the key (the escape hatch back to hosted, and
errors if no key is set). A bare run on an _unpinned_ repo decides from the environment. This is how
a user migrates — e.g. after removing a key, or when a key is rejected.

If a key is used but rejected, `lat reindex` verifies it with a probe embed first (so an invalid key
never wipes a working index), then **asks the user to confirm** the switch to local. On yes it
rebuilds local, records `local:…` in `meta`, and sets the durable `local` preference — so subsequent
`lat search` runs ignore the key and the choice survives a `.cache` wipe or fresh clone (choosing
remote clears it). `--yes` skips the confirmation (CI / non-interactive); when the shell isn't a TTY
and `--yes` isn't given, it errors rather than switching without consent.

A rejected key (401/403) is distinct from a **malformed or unsupported key prefix** (e.g. an
Anthropic `sk-ant-…` key, or an unrecognized prefix): the latter can't resolve a provider at all, so
`lat reindex` surfaces the provider-detection error as a clean message and exits without touching the
index — it never offers the local switch or crashes.

Implementation: [[src/cli/reindex.ts#reindexCommand]]

## Section Preview

Shared output format used by [[cli#locate]], [[cli#refs]], and [[cli#search]]. Each section is rendered as a bullet (`*`) with:

1. Kind label (`File:` or `Section:`) — file root sections vs subsections
2. Section id in `[[wiki link]]` syntax (path segments dimmed, final segment bold)
3. Match reason in parentheses (e.g. `(exact match)`, `(section name match)`, `(fuzzy match, distance 2)`)
4. "Defined in" label with file path (cyan) and line range
5. Body text quoted with `>` (first paragraph, guaranteed ≤250 chars by [[cli#check#sections]])

Commands that return multiple results use `formatResultList()` which adds a markdown `##` heading and consistent spacing.

Implementation: [[src/format.ts]] — exports [[src/format.ts#formatSectionId]], [[src/format.ts#formatSectionPreview]], [[src/format.ts#formatResultList]], and [[src/format.ts#formatNavHints]]
