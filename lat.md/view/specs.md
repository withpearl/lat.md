# View Tests

Functional specifications for the local browser, deployable builds, client navigation, and `lat ui` startup.

## Serves the document index and browser shell

The loopback server exposes the visible Markdown index and renders its entry at `/`. Other documents use their extensionless vault-relative paths, without a fixed prefix; missing routes return 404.

The live shell identifies its entry without enabling static mode. Reserved UI namespaces and generated-file collisions are rejected rather than silently shadowing documents.

Requesting the same route with `.md` returns the exact known vault file as `text/markdown`; missing or escaping paths remain unavailable. `HEAD` returns the same source headers without a body.

Relative images and other non-Markdown files resolve through vault-contained resource routes. Missing files, directories, and paths that escape through traversal or symlinks remain unavailable.

By default the header renders the compact, solid-cell Lat wordmark bundled in [[view/src/logo.svg]], without shaded cells. This asset is independent of logos embedded in Markdown content. `lat ui --logo-text <text>` replaces it with safely rendered plain text.

The browser shell keeps a default-self Content Security Policy while allowing OpenFreeMap tiles, GitHub-hosted images, Shields badges, and data-backed renderer fonts.

The server anchors Vite's relative entry assets at `/assets/`, so every live document, source, search, and graph route loads the same production shell.

## Builds a static deployment

`lat ui build static [output]` emits a host-ready immutable snapshot with physical extensionless document and source routes, lazy graph data, and a compatibility entrypoint for old graph URLs.

Without an explicit output, it writes `.lat-build/static/`.

Documents use root-relative extensionless routes, with only the configured base as a prefix. Generated, relative, search, backlink, and graph links follow this mapping; each document also emits its exact source at the corresponding `.md` URL.

The build copies each vault-local resource reached from a rendered document once, preserves its vault-relative path, and rewrites its URL under the configured deployment base.

The static client keeps Markdown and wiki navigation, backlinks, validation, source views, TOCs, and graph inspection. It does not expose Git, search, or the runtime-only section command, perform live API requests, or subscribe to project changes.

Generated shells encode their base path, optional search endpoint, manifest, and initial route response as inert metadata rather than inline JavaScript, so static routing initializes under the same strict Content Security Policy as the portable server. Initial documents render without fetching JSON.

Every manifest-selected JSON payload is named by a digest of its serialized content. The portable server gives these payloads and Vite assets immutable cache headers while keeping the stable manifest revalidatable.

The compatibility entrypoint preserves URL fragments through a same-origin external redirect helper, with a visible destination link as its no-script fallback.

Every source file stores its raw text and highlighted lines once. Request-specific focus, context, and reference metadata stays in small separate payloads, so multiple links into one file do not duplicate its code.

`lat ui build static --logo-text <text>` persists the same plain-text override in the static manifest; without it, the exported client uses the bundled Lat wordmark.

A `--base` path, with or without a leading slash, nests the payload under that path as well as prefixing its URLs. Root and nested builds keep document routes, raw Markdown, entry navigation, and assets consistent without an implicit `/docs/` segment.

Entry assets use that base, while lazy JavaScript, CSS, fonts, and renderer chunks resolve relative to their owning production asset. Rich fences therefore work at both root and nested deployments.

Any existing output path is rejected before snapshot work begins, including an empty directory or prior export. `--force` explicitly replaces it, but only after the complete successor has staged successfully. Transient busy-file errors during the final move are retried; destinations that could contain the project remain forbidden.

## Mounts documents at the configured base

Live, static, and server UIs render the entry at the mount root and other documents at extensionless vault-relative paths. Only an explicit build base adds a prefix; real `docs/` folders remain ordinary content.

Root and nested builds preserve encoded filenames, relative links, fragments, raw Markdown, and assets. Reserved UI routes and file/directory collisions fail explicitly, with no legacy document aliases.

## Builds a portable server deployment

`lat ui build server [output]` emits immutable public routes plus a portable Express application whose only dynamic feature is semantic search.

The build creates its vector index once and stores flat section metadata beside it. Runtime search copies the database to writable temporary storage, resolves results without Markdown parsing, and never rebuilds the index. A warm server instance reuses one database handle and embedder across queries, then closes the handle before deleting owned temporary storage.

The generated package directly imports and constructs its pinned Express version for framework detection, then passes that app to the shared runtime and delegates `npm start`, security headers, static caching, listening, and shutdown to `@lat.md/server`. No generated listener implementation is serialized into the artifact.

The entrypoint passes literal module-relative manifest and index URLs as real runtime inputs and injects a search-engine factory made from ordinary embedding-engine and model imports. The runtime derives the sibling `public/` directory from the manifest instead of exposing it to file tracing; CDN-aware hosts publish that root directory without duplicating it inside the function. Package-owned code loads its own WASM and model assets, so file tracing follows the actual runtime graph without include globs or tracing-only expressions.

Its static fallback preserves configured base paths, extensionless UI routes, and exact raw `.md` files on non-CDN hosts. `/` renders the configured entry document directly; `index.html` is only the physical file, and its filename route redirects home.

The static client exposes Search only when the build advertises an endpoint. Editing, Git state, event streams, repository access, and the runtime section command remain disabled.

### Runs the generated Node artifact end to end

The Node-target regression test builds a complete portable artifact, loads its generated entrypoint against installed workspace packages, and serves it over loopback HTTP.

Indexing runs in a child process that exits before staging is renamed, releasing native SQLite handles on Windows. The existing analyzed snapshot crosses the process boundary intact, and indexing errors reject the build before publication.

Shutdown closes search and retries removal of its owned runtime cache. Persistent Windows lock errors on that disposable copy do not fail shutdown; other cleanup errors still surface.

It verifies the document shell, immutable JavaScript and CSS assets, and semantic results from the real local embedding model and built SQLite index. The test therefore covers the generated application contract rather than substituting a fake search handler.

## Selects server deployment targets

`lat ui build server [output] --target node|vercel` keeps Node as the portable default while making platform packaging explicit.

The `node` target defaults to `.lat-build/server/`. The `vercel` target defaults to `.vercel/output/`, builds the same Node artifact in temporary staging, installs production dependencies without lifecycle scripts, converts it into Build Output API v3, and removes staging. Output, base, force, and logo options apply to both.

## Builds Vercel output directly

The public Vercel target and repository preview convert an installed portable server artifact into Build Output API v3 without recursively invoking Vercel CLI.

`web/public/` becomes the CDN `static/` tree. Vercel's Node File Trace selects the entrypoint, server manifest, vector index, runtime packages, WASM engine, and model weights for one base-path-specific search function without copying public content into it.

The Vercel packager explicitly includes the search manifest and the database it names, since static tracing cannot resolve filenames stored in JSON. Missing database files fail the build before replacing an existing output. Other runtime assets are reachable through a static import or `new URL(relativePath, import.meta.url)`. The embedding loader owns WASM initialization rather than relying on generated CommonJS glue to perform an opaque filesystem read.

The generated configuration applies the shared security policy, gives content-addressed JSON and Vite assets immutable caching, resolves functions and exact static files first, and maps extensionless routes to their physical `index.html` files.

## Builds this repository's site directly

The repository's separate site project builds the same portable server artifact exposed by the CLI, with no deployment-only application wrapper or duplicate GitHub Actions build.

`pnpm build:site` hydrates version-matched published embedding artifacts, builds the shared server and browser, then invokes `lat ui build server` with its default `.lat-build/server/` output.

The Vercel build vendors this branch's `lat.md` and `@lat.md/*` packages into the artifact under content-addressed archive names, so the deployment installs the pull request rather than released npm packages.

`pnpm build:site:vercel` is the project's sole build command. It installs that artifact without lifecycle scripts and writes `.vercel/output` directly; the repository requires no Vercel manifest, root Express app, nested Vercel CLI build, or artifact handoff between CI systems.

Hosted previews intentionally use published embedding packages. Chunked retrieval requires `@lat.md/embed@0.2.1` or later for the WASM token-counting API; publish that version before deploying the retrieval integration. `pnpm build:site:source` validates local engine or model changes, which cannot appear in a hosted preview until their package versions are published.

## Keeps build-only packages out of runtime dependencies

The published CLI declares browser renderer inputs and test-only serializers as development dependencies because consumers execute prebuilt artifacts and should not install redundant source trees.

Node File Trace remains a runtime dependency because the installed CLI invokes it when users select the Vercel server target; the Vercel CLI itself is not required.

## Renders canonical document trees

Document, Git, section-output, reference, and highlighted-source APIs expose versioned JSON trees of safe root, element, and text nodes without legacy HTML fields.

Markdown, reStructuredText, and AsciiDoc normalize into the same protocol. Native external parse trees project directly without an HTML round trip; shared tree decoration marks external links, and the client rejects executable properties and unsafe URL protocols.

External-document repository links resolve against the document's source path. Files present in the project's explicit external set receive canonical routes; unavailable relative targets become visibly muted, non-interactive nodes.

Static export discovers and rewrites links by traversing node properties while retaining the same document-tree payload as the live server.

## Copies code blocks

Code-block clipboard controls sit outside the scrollable source, appear on hover or keyboard focus, and remain visible on touch devices without changing the code's content or highlighting.

### Copies plain and highlighted text

Each rendered `pre` copies its own plain text with indentation, special characters, and trailing newlines intact. Inline code has no button, success is announced temporarily, and static views retain the action.

### Reports clipboard failures

Missing clipboard APIs or denied permissions show a retryable failure rather than false success. Retrying can succeed without replacing the code or navigating the page.

## Renders Markdown with navigable local links

Markdown normalizes into a safe tree with GitHub-style heading ids and intact relative destinations. HTTP(S) and protocol-relative links gain decorative external-site icons in documents and reference contexts.

Links wrapping images omit the external-site icon so badges and other linked embeds remain visually intact.

GitHub-flavored pipe tables render as semantic HTML tables. Wide tables stay within the document column and scroll horizontally instead of flattening into pipe-delimited text or widening the page.

Single- and double-tilde GitHub strikethrough syntax renders semantic deleted text rather than literal delimiters.

GitHub task-list markers render checked or unchecked disabled checkboxes with compact list alignment, preserving document readability without implying that the source file can be edited from the viewer.

Bare HTTP(S), `www.`, and email addresses render as links. Web addresses receive the same external-site treatment as explicit Markdown links, while trailing prose punctuation stays outside the destination.

GitHub-compatible raw HTML renders only through the sanitizer allowlist. Safe formatting and disclosure elements survive, while scripts, event handlers, and unsafe URL protocols never reach the client.

Fenced code blocks with supported language labels render escaped, server-side syntax-highlighted markup. Unknown labels remain safely escaped plain code.

Inline and display math render as accessible KaTeX after authored HTML has been sanitized, including display math written with dollar blocks or `math` code fences.

`mermaid` fences retain escaped source in server and static payloads, then lazily become React-owned SVG element trees in the browser. Invalid syntax leaves the source visible with a safe inline error instead of removing the block.

`geojson` and `topojson` fences replace source with a fixed-height loading shell before first paint, then lazily render their data over OpenFreeMap's hosted OpenStreetMap basemap. They retain visible attribution and fall back to an interactive local geometry view when tiles cannot load. Malformed data, renderer failures, and rejected lazy imports restore escaped source with a safe inline error and retry action.

ASCII `stl` fences lazily render as responsive 3D models with rotation, zoom, automatic framing, centered geometry, and a canvas constrained to its viewport at every pixel ratio. Invalid models or unavailable WebGL leave escaped source visible with a safe inline error.

GitHub `NOTE`, `TIP`, `IMPORTANT`, `WARNING`, and `CAUTION` alert blockquotes render as labeled callouts with type-specific color, while non-alert blockquotes retain their ordinary presentation.

GitHub footnotes render linked superscript references and a compact end section with return links, rather than being misread as ordinary Markdown reference links.

Recognized GitHub emoji shortcodes render as accessible Unicode emoji or GitHub custom emoji assets; unknown shortcodes stay literal, and rendering never rewrites the authored Markdown.

GitHub conversation references such as `#26`, `GH-26`, account mentions, and commit SHAs remain literal in Lat documents, matching repository-file rendering. Full GitHub URLs remain ordinary external links rather than conversation-only shortlinks or embeds.

## Shows a local table of contents

Markdown documents expose their H1 plus nested subsection headings in a sticky right rail on wide screens. The root entry stays bold without shifting subsection indentation; every entry links to its canonical fragment.

The fixed-width desktop rail fills the available viewport height without programmatic resizing. Its list stays content-height when short and scrolls without a visible scrollbar when long; fixed link metrics never compress, and short final sections activate in sequence.

The active indicator stays within the desktop rail; dropdowns omit it. The compact dropdown and expanded list align with the reading column's right edge, and its trigger matches View/Edit's height and vertical center.

The active section's complete subtree remains subtly highlighted across subsection transitions and clears when entering a sibling section. Active ancestors retain their own indented bars, including skipped heading levels; only the current heading has `aria-current`.

Desktop bars glide between headings at each indentation level and resize for wrapped titles. Layout changes update their positions; reduced-motion preferences disable both bar transitions and smooth TOC scrolling. Dropdowns remain bar-free.

TOC auto-scrolling continuously eases toward the active heading without restarting when the target changes. Motion is frame-rate independent, stops for direct wheel, touch, pointer, or keyboard interaction, and snaps immediately with reduced motion.

On wide screens, View/Edit stays at the reading column's right edge with or without a TOC, including Edit mode. A missing compact TOC lets the header span the reading column without changing the prose width limit.

Sections containing rendered Git changes carry an orange disc when Git is enabled, while sections owning validation errors carry a red disc. Both remain visible together when both states apply.

## Adapts navigation to mobile screens

Below 64rem, files remain reachable through a sticky two-row header and a scrollable full-viewport navigation overlay instead of a compressed or hidden desktop sidebar.

The overlay exposes its expanded state, uses touch-sized file targets, locks document scrolling while open, and closes on navigation, Escape, or a return to desktop width. Content gutters narrow, code scrolls horizontally without browser text inflation, and the graph stacks above its inspector.

The Files and TOC icons, metadata, and reading text share a consistent left gutter across tablet and phone widths.

Long unbroken text and inline code wrap within the reading column, while fenced code retains local horizontal scrolling. Map-loading error messages wrap inside their panel and keep Retry reachable without widening the page.

When the desktop TOC rail no longer fits, a compact `On This Page` control shares an aligned metadata row and expands its links in a bounded overlay without moving content. On mobile it becomes a full-width row below the app header, retains active and Git/error states, closes after selection or Escape, and offsets fragment targets.

Desktop header controls align vertically, including read-only documents without a presentation switch.

## Renders the graph workspace

Graph mode consumes a cached projection of documents, source targets, and code mentions with stable nodes and weighted directed edges. Section links collapse into their owning document rather than producing section nodes.

The client renders a 50/50 graph and inspector. The logo and Graph toggle retain their normal desktop positions while floating over the graph with the semantic filter; Git and page Search are hidden. The right panel begins with the node preview and has no toolbar.

On desktop the canvas extends behind the translucent inspector, whose backdrop filter blurs and desaturates only the underlying graph. Camera framing and Fit retain the left-half interaction area, and resizing preserves relative zoom and its center. The inspector keeps its own scrolling and pointer input; mobile panes stay stacked and opaque.

Switching between graph and regular view preserves the logo and toolbar's vertical position at every breakpoint.

The graph button persists a namespaced `localStorage` presentation setting without changing the current URL or browser history. Toggling it off immediately reveals the exact selected target in the normal file/source layout, and reload restores the stored mode.

Plain document, section, source, and code-reference links navigate through their normal URLs without leaving Graph, so Back and Forward work without mode-specific history. Relative fragments resolve against the previewed document without refetching its content.

Document and code areas grow linearly with incoming references above a visible baseline, without size inflation on selection. Focus labels report exact counts; theme-aware text halos replace opaque label plates. Background edges are fine lines, with arrows reserved for focused relationships.

Local document counts sum direct backlinks to all headings, including nested sections and same-document links, with heading-badge paragraph deduplication. Visible edges retain occurrence weights and omit self-loops.

Renderer-safe colors and premultiplied alpha keep edges visible and overlapping circles distinct without corrupting picking IDs. Selection stays emphasized while other nodes are hovered.

Node positions remain fixed during pointer dragging; only the camera pans. Hover highlighting, click navigation, and zoom remain enabled.

Graph uses a cached projection and a deterministic layout without force simulation or settling animation.

Graph search debounces through the embedding-backed `/api/search` service used by `lat search`. Matching sections filter to their owning documents and adjacent code nodes without rendering a result popup. Their radii normalize by hit score; clearing search restores backlink sizing.

## Searches sections with embeddings

Search debounces hybrid queries and renders matching passages linked to section anchors. Results carry a finite rankScore, separate optional cosine similarity, introduction text, and source evidence.

The URL preserves the latest query; Back restores it, and Escape clears the query before returning to the page that opened search. Clicking the active Search icon closes the search immediately without clearing first.

## Formats hybrid search results

Search cards show result rank, ancestor breadcrumbs, section title, match channels, source lines, and a precise hybrid score. Optional details distinguish cosine similarity and channel ranks without presenting confidence percentages.

Evidence renders prose, emphasis, code, lists, and tables. Raw HTML remains inert text, and preview images or links do not trigger external loads or unintended navigation. Missing semantic evidence is shown as absent rather than zero similarity.

## Expands matching passages

Long search passages can expand and collapse without leaving the results page. The control exposes its expanded state and keeps the section link independently navigable.

## Highlights search destination passages

Search result links carry the preview's source ranges while retaining the section anchor. The document highlights matching rendered paragraphs and code blocks, leaving unrelated content unchanged; ordinary navigation removes the highlights.

## Validates search highlight ranges

Malformed, reversed, zero, and unsafe source-line ranges are ignored. Nested matches highlight the smallest overlapping block instead of an entire containing list, and results without evidence keep ordinary section URLs.

## Exposes code-mention frontmatter as metadata

Documents expose [[markdown#Frontmatter#require-code-mention]] separately from the rendered document tree so the browser can badge files that require code references.

## Edits local Markdown safely

Live local documents expose a View/Edit split control that swaps rendered Markdown for a soft-wrapped, syntax-highlighted CodeMirror surface without exposing editing in static exports or external documents.

The editor loads raw source on demand and writes only from its Save button or the platform save shortcut. Saving, saved, unsaved, and conflict states remain visible without blocking further typing.

Added, modified, and deleted lines receive subdued gutter markers against the last loaded or saved source. Markers clear when edits are reverted or saved and reset when clean content reloads from disk.

Leaving Edit, navigating away, or entering Graph requires confirmation while a draft is dirty. Reloading or closing the page requests the browser's native unsaved-changes confirmation, while canceled transitions keep the draft mounted.

Each save applies the user's delta from the last loaded or acknowledged text to the latest file content on disk. Unrelated concurrent changes survive, overlapping changes fail visibly while retaining the draft, and successful writes immediately refresh the live project snapshot.

### Does not replay uncertain writes

An interrupted editor PATCH becomes a visible error without automatic replay because the first request may already have reached disk; safe read requests retain their one retry.

## Resolves Markdown and source wiki links

Resolved Markdown sections and validated source definitions become client-side links, while unresolved wiki targets remain authored text.

Ordinary relative source links also open the code viewer regardless of Git tracking, including nested Markdown paths, encoded spaces, and reference-style links. The live route reads UTF-8 text from disk even without symbol-parser support, including Swift, shell scripts, entitlements, and extensionless files. Binary files and escaping paths remain rejected.

Code links show a language badge bound to the label's first word so it cannot wrap alone, while unaliased links visually separate muted path context from the final target.

Every resolved wiki link shows the total number of distinct reference locations for its canonical target. The current paragraph counts once, duplicate links in one paragraph do not inflate the total, and section totals include `@lat:` code references.

Source-symbol totals cover the exact symbol, while file-only source totals include references to any symbol in that file. Totals below two, unresolved links, and ambiguous links show no count.

## Serves source definitions securely

Source routes return supported project files and optional symbol ranges while rejecting traversal, unsupported extensions, missing symbols, and files outside the project root.

## Shows source reference context

Source links preserve their originating section and line so the code view can render the linking paragraph, emphasize the selected link, and expose other referencing sections.

## Shows section back-references

Every section exposes a burger-icon menu with a count only when references exist. It lists distinct Markdown and code back-references or an empty state, and can navigate to and copy the section URL.

Muted actions stack below the references with “Copy link to the section” first. They can also copy the canonical ID accepted by `lat section`. The topmost local Markdown section links to the raw `.md` file, while external documents omit that action.

Following the menu link returns the exact source from both the live UI and generated Node server. Homepages retain their `/<file>.md` source route, and nested deployments preserve their base path.

In live views, the output modal defaults to the shared React tree renderer and offers a raw-text toggle; static exports omit this runtime-only action.

## Updates long-running views incrementally

Changing, adding, or deleting project files updates cached documents, navigation, source references, and backlinks without rereading unchanged Markdown files.

Browser clients receive a change event and refresh the current route while keeping its URL and viewport stable.

Internal parser, search, and external-source cache writes do not publish project generations or restart in-flight document requests.

### Accepts restarted server generations

Each event stream identifies its server lifetime, so reconnecting after a restart accepts reset generations and invalidates document and graph data from the prior process.

### Releases background event streams

Hidden tabs and suspended pages close their live-update streams so they do not exhaust browser connections and stall navigation.

Returning to a visible page reconnects once; the ready event catches up missed generations. Unmounting removes all lifecycle listeners.

### Times out stalled document requests

A document request that never settles becomes a visible error with a retry action instead of leaving the route on an indefinite loading state.

### Recovers interrupted document requests

A transport-interrupted document request retries once. A repeated interruption becomes a visible retryable error, while navigation cancellations remain silent and never overwrite the next route.

## Refreshes search after Markdown changes

The first search indexes lazily, while a later Markdown generation triggers exactly one shared incremental indexing pass before new queries run.

## Shows live validation errors

Invalid Markdown files show a sidebar marker propagated through every ancestor directory, plus a top metadata error label whose entries jump to red-marked authored content.

The initial snapshot and every refresh recompute diagnostics from cached AST-free file analyses, removing markers immediately when errors are fixed.

## Shows live Git state

Git worktrees show cached HEAD changes as yellow modified or green new-file markers, split with red for validation errors, while rendered Markdown highlights removed and added words inline.

Every rendered block in a new Markdown file inherits the added state, including headings, unordered and ordered lists with their markers, and fenced code blocks.

Compatible table edits retain one rendered table, place inline additions and removals inside changed cells, and color inserted or deleted rows. Incompatible column or alignment changes fall back to colored whole-table replacements.

Changed inline math keeps its surrounding prose and marks the rendered old and new formulas inline. Display-dollar and fenced math changes remain rendered inside removed and added block treatments.

Rendered Mermaid and other rich fences preserve their Git diff state after replacing source blocks: removed versions have a red container; added versions have a green container. Unchanged diagrams have neither treatment.

Blocks with less than 60% ordered word-token overlap render as whole removed and added blocks instead of noisy word-level replacements.

Startup reads Git once, and a later vault change refreshes that state. Polling also detects commits without filesystem events, clearing stale diff markers while unchanged Git snapshots remain silent.

The top Git toggle hides or reveals both sidebar markers and inline diffs without changing the underlying files.

The Git button retains an orange notification dot whenever changes exist, independent of the toggle state.

## Places context within a collapsed source window

Focused source views place reference context before the highlighted definition, keep five surrounding lines, and reveal collapsed code without moving the visible anchor.

## Highlights source syntax safely

Supported languages, including Dart and Java, become structured line trees without HTML serialization. HTML-like source remains inert text and multiline tokens retain their styling across every line.

## Uses Geist syntax colors

Code fences and source views share light/dark syntax roles. Keywords, strings, constants, and functions retain distinct colors; parameters, properties, punctuation, and string substitutions stay neutral.

## Builds a nested file tree

Vault paths form a hierarchy with root and directory index files pinned first and complete paths retained for navigation. Natural sorting provides a fallback while an index is missing or incomplete.

Selecting a directory opens its `name/name.md` index and keeps the directory expanded.

### Uses authored index order

Each directory lists its pages and child directories in the order of its index entries, after the pinned index page. Aliases and optional file extensions preserve the order; stale links do not create sidebar entries.

In an invalid working tree, unlisted files remain visible after listed entries in natural order so authors can repair their indexes. This fallback does not permit orphan pages to pass validation. External files keep their natural order.

### Shares directory order across live and exported views

The sidebar consumes directory order from cached Markdown analysis through the shared UI index. Reordering an index updates live navigation, and static exports carry the same order without additional document requests.

## Stabilizes fragment navigation immediately

Fragment links position rendered documents without smooth scrolling so content is immediately interactive.

Changing only a Markdown fragment preserves the mounted document and cached response through direct clicks and Back or Forward navigation, avoiding a loading state or full-content repaint.

Selecting the H1 entry in the page TOC keeps its canonical fragment while positioning the document at scroll-top zero instead of aligning the rendered heading.

### Preserves rich renderers

Fragment-only rerenders preserve the keyed React fence components, while a changed document tree updates or unmounts Mermaid, map, and STL resources through normal component lifecycle.

## Restores history scroll positions

In-app navigation records each viewport and restores it before revealing content reached through Back.

Search waits for asynchronous results before restoring its saved viewport.

## Rejects files outside the Markdown vault

The document API rejects traversal and non-Markdown targets so browser requests cannot read arbitrary project files.

## Launches the browser after the server starts

`lat ui` prefers loopback port 4242, advances when an implicit default is occupied, and starts listening before passing the final URL to the platform browser launcher.

An explicit `--port <number>` accepts 1–65535 and fails clearly rather than selecting another port when occupied. Startup reports the URL and points users to both deployment build targets.
